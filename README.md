# Import Any Table
Proof-of-concept project to import data formatted in tables, from multiple different file formats.

Currently somewhat naively importing.

Future intent is to use this for user-friendly table manipulation, search, and display.

# Currently supported file extensions
- csv
- html
- xls (pre-2007 Microsoft Excel format)
- xlsx (2007+ Microsoft Excel format)
- ods (LibreOffice format - requires additional installations)

# Future Improvements
Handle unusual tables non-naively

Integrate additional file types
